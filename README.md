# E-Commerce-Automation
### Requirements:

App URL: https://v0-ecommerce-feature-flow.vercel.app/

* Part 1: Testing Plan
Write at least 10 test cases describing key user actions related to adding products to the cart and completing checkout. Each should specify expected user behavior and outcomes.

* Part 2: Automated Playwright Test
Choose one test case from Part 1 and implement it as an end-to-end test using cypress. The test must run at desktop resolution.

* Part 3: Delivery Requirements
Create a GitHub repository containing your Playwright automation project.
Implement a CI workflow in GitHub Actions named Regression Pipeline, triggered manually via workflow_dispatch, that runs your Playwright tests.
Integrate a test reporting tool (e.g., Allure Report or another of your choice) into your automation repo.
The CI pipeline must generate and output the test report as part of the workflow.
Expectations
Test cases should focus on key user flows, emphasizing outcomes over implementation details.
The automated test should be robust and reflect real user behavior.
The CI setup should allow manual test runs and clearly present test report results.]
